## USER STORY
AS A NATIONAL TOURIST AGENCY,
I WANT A WEB APPLICATION TO SHOW THE WEATHER ON A MAP AND STORE WEATHER INFORMATION ON NEXT 5 DAYS IN DIFFERENT LOCATION   
SO THAT TOURIST CAN MAKE GOOD PLAN BASED ON THE WEATHER FOR THEIR TRIP


## PROJECT DISCRIPTION 
This platform allows the user to click a city on the map. In response to clicking, current weather information for the day and the weather forecast for the next 6 days are displayed to the user.

The user can add more cities if they wish to monitor the weather in that city. The userâ€™s selection is stored locally, and upon revisiting the platform, they can view their previous selections.
